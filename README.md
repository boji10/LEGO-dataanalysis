# Rebrickable LEGO Dataset Data Modeling and Analysis

In this project, I go through the data model of the Rebrickable LEGO Dataset and then create a database for analytics. I go through real scenarios of answering questions about data with SQL. I startED with basic SQL queries and then explore more complex problems using JOINS, CTEs, and WINDOW functions.

## Skills covered in this project:

-Creating a database in SQL Server

-Two different methods of importing files into a database

-SQL JOINS

-SQL WINDOW functions

-Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

## About the Rebrickable LEGO Dataset

The Rebrickable LEGO Dataset is a comprehensive collection of data about LEGO sets, parts, and minifigures. It includes information on sets, parts, colors, and themes. The data is provided in CSV format and can be used to answer a variety of questions about LEGO sets and their components.

## Project overview

In this project, I will go through the following steps:

-Set up a SQL Server database and import the Rebrickable LEGO Dataset CSV files into it.

-Write basic SQL queries to extract information from the database.

-Use JOINS, CTEs, and WINDOW functions to answer more complex questions about the data.
